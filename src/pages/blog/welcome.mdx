Welcome to my blog! This is a space where I'll be sharing thoughts and learnings from over a decade of building and scaling B2B SaaS products.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **AI Product Strategy**: Practical approaches to building AI-powered features that create real customer value
- **Product Leadership**: Frameworks, mental models, and lessons from uniting product, engineering, and design teams
- **PLG & Growth**: Experimentation, retention optimization, and scaling product-led businesses
- **Remote Team Management**: Building high-performing distributed teams with async-first communication

## Why Now?

After years of heads-down execution — from scaling Timely to multi-million ARR, building our first AI/ML teams, and unifying product and engineering under one operating model — I want to document and share what's worked (and what hasn't).

The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, and I believe product leaders need to share more openly about how we're navigating this shift.

Stay tuned for more.
